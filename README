This is a pretty straightforward Python script, you just run it with
the root of your music directory as the single command-line argument
and it organizes and transcodes everything as necessary.

The program will replicate my personal preferred music directory
structure, so it may or may not be useful to you.  MP3 and FLAC files
are identified as source files, and copied into

    base_dir/src/Artist Name/Album Name/##-Track Name.ext

Corresponding down-converted ogg files will be located at

    base_dir/ogg/Artist Name/Album Name/##-Track Name.ogg

and MP3 files at

    base_dir/mp3/Artist Name/Album Name/##-Track Name.mp3

and if they're not already present the script will create them.  It
depends on mpg321, flac, oggenc and lame for the conversion, and also
requires the Python library Mutagen for metadata retrieval.
