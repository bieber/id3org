This is a pretty straightforward Python script, you just run it with the root 
of your music directory as the single command-line argument and it organizes 
and transcodes everything as necessary.

The program will replicate my personal preferred music directory structure, so 
it may or may not be useful to you.  MP3 and FLAC files are identified as 
source files, and copied into
        base_dir/src/Artist Name/Album Name/##-Track Name.ext
Corresponding down-converted ogg files will be located at 
        base_dir/ogg/Artist Name/Album Name/##-Track Name.ogg
and if they're not already present the script will create them.  It depends on 
mpg321, flac and oggenc for the conversion, and also requires the Python 
library Mutagen for metadata retrieval.
